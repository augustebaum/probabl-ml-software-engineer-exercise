Here is the exercise description:
> Using `sklearn.model_selection.permutation_test_score`, compute the p-value indicating if the score obtained by an instance of `sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier` on the dataset `sklearn.datasets.load_iris` is obtained by chance.
> 
> Repeat this analysis using `sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier` instead of `sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`.
> 
> What can you conclude about:
> - the existence of a significant statistical association between the iris type and the input features (petal and sepal width and length)?
> - the ability of each kind of estimator to assess or not such a statistical association between features and target variable?
